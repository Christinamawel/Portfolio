    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a Highly motivated Junior Developer looking to transition my career. I am a reliable 
      worker with a team driven attitude and am productive when working with others as 
      well as on my own. I love to learn and easily adapt to whatever my team may need to 
      get a job done. I have developed great communication skills and translate that into 
      writing organized and readable code.</p>
    <h4>My Favorite Software to work with:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><span>CSS</span>Moving various pieces of data on a page and making it intuitive, beautiful, and professional is something I have grown to love.</li>
      <li><span>React</span>when I first glanced at react many months ago I was intimidated but now it feels like home to me. I am confident while using it and feel its probably one of my strongest languages.</li>
      <li><span>Adobe Photoshop</span>I <em>love</em> mashing photos, text, and art together to create seamless, beautiful layouts.</li>
      <li><span>Javascript</span>Though I started out in a rocky relationship with javascript, I have learned to love solving the various problems it presents and take them on as challenges.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>After getting laid off from my job of 5 years I decided to take my learning from an after-work hobby to full-time studying. I have a love for learning and growing and have used that the past year to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Adobe Illustrator, XD, and Photoshop on my own as well as looking into many other front-end development related technologies.</p>
    <p>The more I learned the more I discovered how much learning I had left to do and that's what brought me to Epicodus school where I have created over 70 projects, many of which while pair programming with different students. While working on these project I have gained a stronger grasp on the languages I learned on my own along with learning new skills like git, team programming workflows, test driven development, C#, MVC.Net Core, SQL Databases, and React Redux.</p>
    <p>I have also continued to study on my own as well and have begun to learn mobile programming in Android Studio with Kotlin. I have learned a lot since I begun my journey into programming and I feel proud of what I have accomplished, however I will never stop continuing to learn and grow from here.</p>
